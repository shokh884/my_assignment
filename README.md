In order to reproduce my code, you need to download all my files.
First, open your stata read my dta and do file, then you can run my codes step by step as shown in do file.
When it comes to python, you can run my python file by reading it in anaconda powershell prompt, then running my codes in it self
I also attached git bush file to show how pushed my files to github.
Just for information lecture notes helped me to do homework, but I also asked my questions from google
So far I wrote many codes, i had errors as well, in order to show my codes more sophisticated so this my last version which is without errors to read
